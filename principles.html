<i>We follow these principles:</i>
</font>

<p><font size="+2">
Our highest priority is to make sure the customer<br>
has no insight on what we are doing and<br>
that she pays as much as possible
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Hate changing requirements, at any point<br>
during development. Sluggish processes harness obscurity and FUD to <br>
make sure the customer gives up getting what she wants
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Deliver apparently working software sporadically, from a <br>
couple of months to a couple of years, with a <br>
preference to the longer timescale
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Business people and developers must blame each other <br>
daily throughout the project
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Build projects around unreliable individuals. <br>
Give them the environment you feel like supporting, the least resources you can, <br>
and always micromanage them to make sure they are as stressed out as possible
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
The most efficient and effective method of <br>
hiding information within a development <br>
team is endless planning, meetings and brainstormings.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Paychecks are the primary measure of progress.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Sluggish processes promote burnout and turnover. <br>
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able <br>
to always be looking for other jobs
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Continuous attention to useless aspects <br>
and outdated documentation enhances confusion
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Busy looping--the art of minimizing the amount <br>
of work not done--is essential.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
The "best" architectures, requirements, and designs <br>
are imposed from the top without any room for discussion
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how <br>
to become more sluggish, harder to inspect and measure, then tunes and adjusts <br>
its behavior accordingly.
